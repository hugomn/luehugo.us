    "Dear,<br /><br /> Due to the recent developments in the Coronavirus pandemic, we decided to postpone our wedding again to April 15th, 2022, the same time and at the same venue. We are concerned about the health and safety of the more than 200 people with whom we would like to be together on May 2nd. üòî <br /><br />It would not be cautious to go forward with this date, so we decided to postpone our wedding until when, according to forecasts, the virus has already been controlled and the risk of contamination in agglomerations has decreased substantially. We chose the new date thinking about everyone who already has flight tickets and bookings scheduled, because we believe airlines and hotels will be more flexible. <br /><br />We understand that some changes will be required, and we are deeply sorry for all the inconvenience. But the health of our beloved family and friends, the people who live with each one of you, as well as the whole community, must come first. üôèüèª <br /><br />We are sure that this moment will soon pass and we ask that everyone stay healthy. We are closely watching the advance of the pandemic in Brazil and across the world news. It is essential that we avoid gatherings at this time, and the focus now should be to prevent the accelerated spread of the virus. We appreciate the understanding and please count on us for everything you may need. <br /><br />Our very special day will need to wait a bit, but we are sure it will be as special as the first one. And, for that, we need you with us on 04/15/2022! <br /><br />Please, don't forget to fill our new RSVP before 02/28/2022. <br /><br />See you soon! Lu & Hugo üë∞üèºü§µüèΩüß°",
